// E1 — drift migration crash: "duplicate column name: delete_state".
//
// Root cause: `delete_state` was declared on the `messages` table before it had
// its own upgrade step, so fresh installs of those builds created the column via
// onCreate while their stored schemaVersion stayed at 4. On a later upgrade the
// `if (from < 5) addColumn(deleteState)` step then ran
// `ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN delete_state` against an EXISTING column and
// the app crashed at startup — ~3.6k events on 1.0.24/1.0.25 (top crash).
//
// The fix makes every addColumn idempotent (_addColumnIfMissing). This test
// reproduces the broken state (schemaVersion=4 on a DB that already has the
// column) and asserts the upgrade to the current schema completes without
// throwing. It fails on the pre-fix code and passes after it.

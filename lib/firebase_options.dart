// The runtime path is the single source of truth. If the runtime config is
// unavailable (offline first launch with nothing persisted), main.dart falls
// back to Firebase.initializeApp() WITHOUT options, which on Android lets the
// native google-services.json drive initialization (the FCM hybrid). On iOS the
// native GoogleService-Info.plist serves the same role.

/// Central sanitization for user-generated text before it reaches Flutter's
/// native text-layout engine.
///
/// The crash this guards against — `Invalid argument(s): string is not
/// well-formed UTF-16` inside `_NativeParagraphBuilder.addText` — is caused
/// ONLY by LONE (unpaired) UTF-16 surrogate code units. A Dart `String` is a
/// sequence of UTF-16 code units; an astral code point (most emoji, including
/// every glyph of a ZWJ family/profession/flag sequence) is stored as a
/// high+low surrogate PAIR. A pair is valid and must be preserved; a surrogate
/// that is missing its partner is malformed UTF-16 and aborts native layout.
///
/// Therefore [sanitizedForDisplay] is intentionally MINIMAL: it strips only
/// unpaired surrogates (and the genuinely render-breaking C0 control bytes /
/// DEL, which are never legitimate in display text), and leaves everything else
/// exactly as written. In particular it preserves, because they are required
/// for correct rendering and do NOT cause the crash:
///
///   * U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER — joins the parts of family / profession /
///     rainbow-flag emoji; dropping it shatters the sequence into loose glyphs.
///   * U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER — typographically required in Arabic /
///     Persian (e.g. correct presentation forms, plural suffixes).
///   * U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE — legitimate soft-break opportunity.
///   * U+FE0E / U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTORS — select text vs. colour emoji
///     presentation; dropping U+FE0F makes emoji render monochrome.
///   * Bidi marks / overrides / isolates (U+200E, U+200F, U+202A–U+202E,
///     U+2066–U+2069) — needed to order mixed Arabic + Latin / numbers.
///   * Valid surrogate PAIRS — every multi-code-unit emoji and astral glyph.
///
/// A single leading BOM (U+FEFF) is dropped because it is byte-order noise that
/// can render as a stray glyph at the very start; BOMs elsewhere are left alone
/// (mid-string U+FEFF is a zero-width no-break joiner and harmless).
///
/// It is dependency-free (pure Dart) so it runs anywhere and is unit-testable
/// without the Flutter binding.
